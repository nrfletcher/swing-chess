# Swing Chess
A Java Swing based chess application

This implementation is a standalone program meant to be played by two users on the same machine

Will probably never extend this as I wish to stay as far away from Java GUI libraries as possible
# How to run the program
You must have a Java JDK installed (this particular project built in 17.0.3.1)
```
git clone https://github.com/nrfletcher/swing-chess.git
cd swing-chess
cd gchess_jar
java -jar gchess.jar
```
# Architecture
This project utilizes the MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern
* Model -> Game.Board
* View -> Graphics.BoardView
* Controller -> Controller.ChessController

Each package serves a unique purpose but adheres to MVC pattern overall
* Controller -> Contains controller
* Game -> Contains logic implementation, separating concerns to each piece type
* Graphics -> The view and helper classes
* Main -> Entry to the program
* Utils -> Contains helper classes for both model and controller
